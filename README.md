# LCAT-Net: Lightweight Context-Aware Deep Learning Approach for Teeth Segmentation in Panoramic X-rays

## Overview

LCAT-Net is a deep learning model designed to accurately segment teeth in panoramic X-ray images. By preserving both contextual and fine-grained details, LCAT-Net addresses challenges such as blurred interdental boundaries, noise variations, and overlapping dental structures. The model introduces a novel Multi-scale Context Fusion (MCF) block to effectively capture and fuse features from multiple scales, enabling more accurate segmentation of dental structures of varying sizes and orientations. Additionally, a dense skip connection module (DSM) allows each decoder layer to combine details from the symmetric encoder layer and all upper encoder layers. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
